Students should select their first course in mathematics at JHU based on their intended areas of study, prior experience and training in mathematics, and the results of an advisory Placement Exam offered to incoming freshmen. Students intending to major in mathematics, the natural sciences, or engineering, or who are interested in studying mathematics beyond a year of single variable calculus are strongly encouraged to begin with the AS.110.108 Calculus I (Physical Sciences & Engineering) -\u00a0AS.110.109 Calculus II (For Physical Sciences and Engineering) sequence or AS.110.113 Honors Single Variable Calculus.
