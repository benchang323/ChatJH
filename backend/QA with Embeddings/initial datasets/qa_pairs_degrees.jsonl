Topics include career aspects of project management; business factors affecting the project and the manager; project organization, planning, execution, and communications; project life cycle; risk analysis; interface management; design review; design control assessment; reporting; and reaction to critical problems. Students are formed into groups, presented with a scenario that simulates the development of a high-technology system, and assigned to make decisions required of the project manager in the execution of the project. The project manager\u2019s decisions must then be effectively communicated (and perhaps defended) to a variety of audiences (represented by other students and faculty) that include top management, the customer, functional management, and members of the project team. Course Note(s): The format for this course is either online or a mixed online/live environment called Virtual Live. For the Virtual Live format, weekly lectures are provided either online or live (and recorded) on a predesignated day/time, with students/instructors joining from any location via personal computer.

Systems engineering requires an understanding of how people interact with complex systems. Often times, human interaction makes up a substantial portion of system variance and controlling this variance is critical for system performance. Engineers must design interventions to influence people through all aspects of the system. Emerging technology can be used to understand, measure, and assess the effectiveness of interventions to influence human behavior and performance. This course will introduce students to theories of behavior change and provide hands on experience using technologies to measure human-system interaction and influence. Technologies will include biometric, psycho-physiological, and neuroimaging systems."

  "Department website: http://www.mathematics.jhu.edu/  There are three different versions of single variable calculus offered by the Mathematics Department, including 2 versions of semester courses in Calculus I and II, roughly equivalent to Calculus AB and BC in the College Board\u2019s Advanced Placement (AP) system, and a single semester honors version encompassing both Calculus I and II. Students should select their first course in mathematics at JHU based on their intended areas of study, prior experience and training in mathematics, and the results of an advisory Placement Exam offered to incoming freshmen. Students intending to major in mathematics, the natural sciences, or engineering, or who are interested in studying mathematics beyond a year of single variable calculus are strongly encouraged to begin with the AS.110.108 Calculus I (Physical Sciences & Engineering) -\u00a0AS.110.109 Calculus II (For Physical Sciences and Engineering) sequence or AS.110.113 Honors Single Variable Calculus. Students majoring in other subjects, or who do not intend to continue taking mathematics courses beyond a year of calculus, may wish to take the sequence AS.110.106 Calculus I (Biology and Social Sciences) -\u00a0AS.110.107 Calculus II (For Biological and Social Science). This latter sequence relates the methods of calculus to the biological and social sciences. A one-semester pre-calculus course (AS.110.105 Precalculus) is a pre-calculus course offered for students who would benefit from additional preparation in the basic tools (algebra, trigonometry and the properties of functions) used in calculus."

This inclusion offers systematic consideration of the patient's psychiatric condition from four perspectives: disease, dimensional, behavior, and life story.  This 17-credit post-master\u2019s certificate prepares the student to evaluate and treat mental health, substance use, and co-morbid conditions across the lifespan. Those who earn a Psychiatric Mental Health Nurse Practitioner Certificate will develop the competencies to provide a continuum of care that incorporates health promotion, prevention, treatment, recovery, and maintenance. Graduates work in a variety of settings ranging from specialty behavioral health centers to primary care, collaborate with other health care professionals and community organizations to provide evidence- based integrated care, and advocate to reduce inaccurate and hurtful representations of mental and behavioral conditions."
