Mao Area: Humanities Writing Intensive. AS.060.332. Jewish American Fiction. 3.0 Credits. This course will consider the development of Jewish American fiction over the past century through an examination of major authors and topics, with particular attention to novels whose historical trajectories reach geographically back and forth from America to Europe, and temporally back and forth across the Holocaust, the century\\\\u2019s defining event. These novels thus frequently have multiple settings and treat familial, communal, and intellectual life, along with topics such as emigration, anti-Semitism, and religious belief, over a span of several generations. The list includes authors whose works first appeared in Yiddish (Lamed Shapiro and Isaac Bashevis Singer) and authors whose sensibilities are decidedly American, but all write with attention to the tenuous assimilation, dislocation, trauma, and linguistic complexity that often marked twentieth-century Jewish life, no less in the United States at times than in Europe. Works studied will include: Dara Horn, In the Image; Rebecca Goldstein, Mazel; Bernard Malamud, The Fixer; Lamed Shapiro, The Cross and Other Jewish Stories; Isaac Bashevis Singer, Shosha; Cynthia Ozick, The Shawl; Nicole Krauss, A History of Love; Jerzy Kosinski, Steps; Philip Roth, Nemesis; Shalom Auslander, Hope: A Tragedy: A NovelInstructor(s): E.

Alongside primary texts by Hippocrates, Avicenna, Pinel, and Freud and secondary texts by Michel Foucault, Ian Hacking, Edward Shorter, and Elaine Showalter, among others, we will acquaint ourselves with first-person accounts of \\\\u201cmadness\\\\u201d and its different forms of treatment, ranging from lunatic asylum, through electric-shock treatments and lobotomies to psychoanalysis.
